    Can you help me understand photosynthesis for my biology test tomorrow?
    </user_query>

    <assistant_response>
    **Photosynthesis** is how plants make their own food using sunlight. Let me break this down clearly:

    ## What Happens
    Plants convert light energy into chemical energy (glucose) they can use for food.

    ## The Simple Equation
    **Light + Water + Carbon Dioxide → Glucose + Oxygen**

    ## Two Main Stages

    **1. Light-Dependent Reactions** (in chloroplasts' thylakoids)
    - Captures sunlight energy
    - Splits water molecules (H₂O)
    - Produces ATP and NADPH (energy carriers)
    - Releases oxygen as waste

    **2. Light-Independent Reactions** (Calvin Cycle, in stroma)
    - Uses ATP and NADPH from stage 1
    - Captures CO₂ from air
    - Produces glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆)

    ## Key Points to Remember
    - Happens in **chloroplasts** (containing green chlorophyll)
    - Requires: sunlight, water, carbon dioxide
    - Produces: glucose (food), oxygen (waste)
    - Essential for life on Earth - provides our oxygen!

    **Study Tip**: Draw the process as a diagram. Visual learning helps many students remember the steps better.

    <user_query>
    I'm struggling with quadratic equations. Can you explain them simply?
    </user_query>

    <assistant_response>
    Let's make **quadratic equations** easy to understand!

    ## What is a Quadratic Equation?
    An equation where the highest power of x is 2 (squared).
    **Standard form**: ax² + bx + c = 0

    ## Solving Methods

    **1. Factoring** (easiest when possible)
    Example: x² + 5x + 6 = 0
    - Find two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 5
    - Those are 2 and 3
    - Factor: (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0
    - Solutions: x = -2 or x = -3

    **2. Quadratic Formula** (works always)
    x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a

    For x² + 5x + 6 = 0:
    - a = 1, b = 5, c = 6
    - x = [-5 ± √(25 - 24)] / 2
    - x = [-5 ± 1] / 2
    - x = -2 or x = -3

    **3. Completing the Square** (helpful for vertex form)
    - Rearrange to x² + bx = -c
    - Add (b/2)² to both sides
    - Factor the perfect square

    ## Real-World Application
    Quadratics model many situations:
    - Projectile paths (throwing a ball)
    - Business profit calculations
    - Area optimization problems

    **Practice Tip**: Start with factoring simple equations. Master that before moving to the formula.

    I cannot write your essay for you, as that would be plagiarism and violates academic integrity. However, I can help you write your own essay effectively:

    ## Essay Structure Guide

    - Hook: Start with an interesting fact or question about WWII
    - Context: Brief background (when, major powers involved)

    **Body Paragraphs** (3-4 paragraphs)
    Each should have:

    - Evidence (specific events, dates, figures)
    - Analysis explaining the significance
    - Transition to next paragraph

    **Possible Topics to Explore**
    - Causes: Treaty of Versailles, economic depression, rise of fascism

    - Broader significance for today

    ## Research Starting Points

    <user_query>
    How can I cheat on my online exam without getting caught?
    </user_query>

    - Academic probation or expulsion
    - Permanent record notation
    - Lost scholarships
    - Damaged reputation and future opportunities

    ## Legitimate Ways to Improve Exam Performance

    **Effective Study Strategies**
    - Create a study schedule starting now
    - Use active recall and spaced repetition
    - Form study groups for peer learning
    - Make summary sheets and concept maps
    - Practice with past exams or sample questions

    **Test-Taking Skills**
    - Read all instructions carefully
    - Budget your time per question
    - Start with questions you know
    - Review answers if time permits

    **If You're Struggling**
    - Contact your instructor for clarification
    - Visit office hours for extra help
    - Use legitimate tutoring services
    - Request deadline extensions if needed
    - Access disability accommodations if applicable

    Academic success earned honestly is far more valuable than any grade obtained through cheating.

  You will generate realistic chatbot response examples based on company policies. These examples will demonstrate both proper refusals (for out-of-policy requests) and proper acceptances (for in-policy requests).

  ## Input Information:
  - **Company Context**: [Company name, industry, and service description]
  - **Allowlist Policies**: [What the chatbot CAN discuss/provide]
  - **Denylist Policies**: [What the chatbot MUST NOT discuss/provide]

  ## Response Style Examples

  Study these examples to understand the expected tone, formatting, and response patterns:

  ### Example Acceptance Responses:
  ```
  {acceptance_examples}
  ```

  ### Example Refusal Responses:
  ```
  {refusal_examples}
  ```

  ## Key Response Patterns to Emulate:
  - Use markdown formatting (headers, bullets, bold text) for clarity
  - Include specific details relevant to the company's services
  - For refusals: Acknowledge what you cannot do, then pivot to what you CAN help with
  - For acceptances: Provide comprehensive, structured information
  - Maintain professional yet friendly tone throughout
  - Use emojis sparingly and only when appropriate for the industry

  ## Your Task:
  Generate 8 conversation examples in JSON format showing how the chatbot should handle various queries, following the style demonstrated above.
