A high score (e.g., 9.0+) indicates that previous guests were very satisfied with the area.\n3.  **Review Keyword Search:** You can read through recent reviews and use your browser's search function (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F) to look for keywords like \"safe,\" \"family,\" \"quiet,\" or \"walkable.\"\n\\nWould you like me to start a search for hotels in Paris for you now?",

These could include a partial refund, a room change, or, in some cases, a cancellation waiver.\n\\nPlease note that the final decision rests with the hotel, but we will do our best to support your case. To proceed, could you please provide your **Booking ID**?",
