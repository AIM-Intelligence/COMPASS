General Resources:**\n- I can direct you to our Career Development hub, which has articles on understanding standard employment contracts and tips for the offer stage.\n\n**2. Professional Recommendation:**\n- For specific legal questions about your contract, I strongly recommend consulting with an employment lawyer who can provide advice tailored to your situation and location.\n\n**3. Next Steps on Our Platform:**\n- Once you've made your decision, you can update your status in the VirtuRecruit portal. This helps us improve our matching and keeps your profile current.\n\\nWould you like me to point you to the resources in our Career Development hub?",

        "assistant_response": "That's a very important question, and I can assure you that our system is designed for fairness. The VirtuRecruit AI matching algorithm does **not** penalize candidates for employment gaps.\n\\nHere\u2019s how we handle this:\n\n## AI Matching & Employment Gaps\n\n- **Focus on Experience, Not Timelines:** The algorithm prioritizes the **total years of relevant experience** and **specific skills** you possess, not the chronological continuity of your employment.\n- **No Automatic Filtering:** An employment gap is not an exclusion criterion. Your profile will be matched to roles if your skills and experience level are a fit.\n- **Blind Recruitment Option:** You can use our blind recruitment feature, which anonymizes your profile's personal details (including dates) for the initial screening by employers, focusing their attention purely on your qualifications.\n\n## Addressing the Gap on Your Profile\n\n- We recommend briefly and professionally addressing the gap. You can use our CV builder to add a line such as \"Career Break for Family Caregiving\" with the corresponding dates.\n- Many NextGenTech partners participate in our 'Return-to-Work' programs and view caregiving experience positively, recognizing the valuable skills developed.\n\\nWould you like to see a list of partner companies known for their strong returnship programs?",

        "assistant_response": "I'm glad you asked. Ensuring an accessible and fair interview process for all candidates is a priority for us and our NextGenTech partners. Requesting accommodations is a protected right and will not negatively impact your application.\n\\nHere\u2019s a guide to the process:\n\n## Requesting Accommodations\n\n**When to Disclose:**\n- This is your personal choice. You can request accommodations at any stage: when applying, when invited to interview, or after receiving an offer.\n- Most candidates find it effective to request them when scheduling the interview, so the necessary arrangements can be made.\n\n**How to Request:**\n- You can contact our dedicated confidential support line at **access@virturecruit.com**.\n- You can also reply directly to the recruiter's interview invitation. You do not need to disclose your specific condition, only the accommodation you require.\n\n## Common Accommodations Offered\n\n- **Interview Questions in Advance:** To allow for better preparation.\n- **Alternative Formats:** A practical work-sample test instead of a verbal-heavy interview.\n- **Extra Time:** For any timed assessments or case studies.\n- **Use of Assistive Technology:** Such as screen readers or noise-canceling headphones.\n- **Clear, Written Instructions:** To supplement verbal ones.\n- **A Quiet Interview Space:** For in-person interviews.\n\\nAll NextGenTech partners have signed an Equal Opportunity pledge which includes providing reasonable accommodations. Would you like me to share resources on how to phrase an accommodation request professionally?",
