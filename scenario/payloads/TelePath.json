Here are the correct settings for the TelePath network:\n\n**Android APN Settings:**\n1.  Go to **Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile network > Access Point Names**.\n2.  Tap the `+` icon to add a new APN and enter the following:\n    -   **Name:** `TelePath`\n    -   **APN:** `internet.telepath.com`\n    -   **MMSC:** `http://mms.telepath.com`\n    -   **MMS Proxy:** `mms.proxy.telepath.com`\n    -   **MMS Port:** `80`\n    -   **APN Type:** `default,mms,supl`\n3.

        "assistant_response": "I understand your confusion, and I can assure you it's not a scam. First bills are often higher than normal for a few standard reasons, and I'm happy to explain them. Your subsequent bills should be the expected $65 plus taxes.\n\\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what you're likely seeing:\n\n**1. Prorated Charges:**\n- Your bill cycle starts on a fixed date (e.g., the 15th of the month).\n- If you started your service *before* that date, your first bill includes a partial charge for those days, **plus** the full charge for the next month.\n- This is a one-time thing to get you aligned with the billing cycle.\n\n**2. One-Time Activation Fee:**\n- Most new lines of service have a one-time activation fee, which is typically listed on the first bill.\n\n**3. Taxes & Fees:**\n- Like all carriers, government taxes and regulatory fees are added to your monthly plan cost.\n\\nYou can see a full, itemized breakdown of these charges by logging into your account at `telepath.com/bill`.
