Insert the new CR2032 battery in the same orientation.\n4.  **Snap it closed**: Press the two halves of the fob firmly back together until they click.\n\\nFor a detailed video tutorial, you can search for \"AutoVia Key Fob Battery Replacement\" on our official YouTube channel or consult your [owner's manual](https://autovia.com/manuals).",
